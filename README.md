Uh, I decided to find out what it's like to make an operating system. It's fun. I mean, why wouldn't it be... I love programming! Although, actually finishing an operating system would be a lot of stress. So... maybe in 47 years I'll complete this. For now, this will remain just a repository to experiment with and as reference.
